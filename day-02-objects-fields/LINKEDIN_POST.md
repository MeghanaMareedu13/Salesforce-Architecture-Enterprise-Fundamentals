🏗️ **Day 2 of 25: Brushing up on Data Modeling & UI Orchestration**

Yesterday was about the foundation. Today is about the **Building Blocks.**

In any enterprise-scale CRM, how you structure your objects and fields determines the quality of your analytics and the speed of your users. Today, I'm deep-diving into the core of **Salesforce Data Modeling.**

**Key deliverables from today’s "Brush-Up" session:**
✅ **Object Strategy**: Managing the balance between Standard and Custom objects for an optimized data footprint.
✅ **Field Engineering**: Implementing diverse data types and enforcing **Field-Level Security (FLS)** to protect sensitive data at the source.
✅ **UI Orchestration**: Architecting **Page Layouts** and **Record Types** to create tailored experiences for different business segments.

**The "Elite" Insight**: It’s not just about creating fields; it’s about architecting a user experience that feels intuitive while maintaining a "Security First" mindset using FLS.
